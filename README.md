# python-fundamentals
This repository serves as a practice ground for exploring core concepts in Python programming. It includes various Python scripts focusing on fundamental building blocks like functions (fonction.py), data structures (list.py), loops (loops.py), and object-oriented programming (oop.py).

Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://PatrickSafari840@github.com/PatrickSafari840/python-fundamentals.git to clone this repository locally.

Set Up Environment.

Exploring the Files:

fonction.py: This script delves into functions, a cornerstone of modular programming in Python. You'll likely find examples of defining functions, passing arguments, and working with return values.
list.py: This script explores lists, a fundamental data structure in Python for storing and managing ordered collections of items. Expect to see examples of creating lists, accessing elements, and performing various list operations.
loops.py: This script tackles loops, a powerful mechanism for automating repetitive tasks in Python. You'll probably find examples of using for and while loops for iterating over sequences or controlling program flow.
oop.py (Optional): This script (if included) might introduce you to object-oriented programming (OOP), a popular paradigm for structuring programs in Python. It could showcase concepts like classes, objects, and methods.
